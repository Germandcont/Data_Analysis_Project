## Marketing Campeign Performance Analysis

In this project, I will analyze the performance of various marketing campaigns carried out by a company in Malaysia. The main objectives are as follows:

Understand and preprocess the dataset: Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA): Discover patterns and meaningful relationships between variables.
Visualize data: Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Draw conclusions: Interpret the results and provide recommendations based on the analysis.
