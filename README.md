## Marketing Campeign Performance Analysis

In this project, my goal will be to analyze the performance of various marketing campaigns carried out by a company in Malaysia, applying data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, exploratory analysis, and visualization to extract valuable insights that could improve these strategies.

Steps to follow: 

- Understand and preprocess the dataset: Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. <br/>
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): Discover patterns and meaningful relationships between variables. <br/>
- Visualize data: Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. <br/>
- Draw conclusions: Interpret the results and provide recommendations based on the analysis. <br/>
